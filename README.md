## Description

Description of movie. 

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was released in 2004 and is rated PG. An addition to the Harry Potter series, Harry Potter attends his third year at Hogwarts. Harry and his fellow classmates receive a new professor for "Against the Dark Arts", Professor Lupin, but there is trouble. A convicted murderer, Sirius Black, escapes Azkaban and is after Harry Potter.

I have seen this movie numereous times; I know word for word. This is one of my all-time favorite movies and rewatching it, as many times as I do, I still learn new things about this movie and the series. This is the first of the Harry Potter series to be dark and mysterious. Also, it brings in many new character who become crucial for the future movies.
